  <h1>Car Price Prediction</h1>

  <h2>About the Project</h2>
  <p>This project predicts the price of cars based on their specifications using machine learning.</p>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Collecting Data:</li>
    <p>Gathered data on various car models, including features like mileage, engine power, brand, and year of manufacture.</p>

    <li>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:</li>
    <p>Cleaned and preprocessed the collected data, handled missing values, and performed necessary transformations.</p>

    <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</li>
    <p>Conducted EDA to gain insights into the dataset, visualize distributions, and analyze relationships between variables.</p>

    <li>Feature Engineering:</li>
    <p>Engineered new features, extracted relevant information, and transformed data for better model performance.</p>

    <li>Model Building:</li>
    <p>Trained machine learning models, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, to predict car prices.</p>

    <li>Model Evaluation:</li>
    <p>Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.</p>

    <li>Deployment:</li>
    <p>Built a user-friendly web application where users can input car specifications and get price predictions.</p>
  </ol>

  <h2>Project Structure</h2>
  <ul>
    
    <li><code>notebooks/</code>: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with data cleaning, EDA, and model training code.</li>
    
  </ul>
